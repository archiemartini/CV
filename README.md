## Archie Martin

A full-stack JavaScript and Ruby developer with a penchant for problem-solving and a winning smile. My experience shows a proven ability to manage priorities, meet deadlines, and produce deliverables.  I've spent the past ten months learning to code, four of those under the tutelage of leading boot camp, Makers Academy. In this time I've discovered I'm capable of learning complex programming languages and concepts with exceptionally fast turnaround. If you're interested in helping me as I continue this journey of discovery, don't hesitate to contact me!

## Experience

#### Makers Academy (march 2022-july 2022)
At Makers, I have studied computer science and metaprogramming principles along with hands-on coding, working on mobile, web and
desktop applications using Ruby and Javascript.

As a student I had the following responsibilities:
- Take ownership of my learning process, time-boxing tasks to increase my learning curve.
- Use Agile methodologies to work effectively in a team, using pair programming, XP values, daily standups and sprint planning.
- Give and receive feedback using code reviews and open/respectful communication.
- Understand project requirements, create user stories, define MVP's features, break features in smaller tasks to easily accomplish them.
- Collaborate with the other team members using GitHub as version control tools and using CI/CD to reduce integration risk.
- Code following principles like TDD and S.O.L.I.D of OOP design pattern to create clear, simple code and well-tested applications.

#### The Cultural Me (sept 2020-sept 2021)
Editorial and Creative Assistant
- Worked in a team to deliver highly succinct educational content to be delivered to a worldwide audience, under weekly deadlines.
- Heavily involved with product development, design, and advertisement.
- Given responsibility for drafting pitches to educational institutions/investors
- Required: fast acquisition of subject knowledge, a constant eye to writing in a strict house style, and seamless communication with colleagues.

#### MediaPlanet (nov 2021-present) 
Freelance Editor & Proofreader
- I leant on my previous experiences in editorial work to turnover articles handed to me within 24 hours.
- Edited pieces were to be published in such publications as The Times, The Guardian and The Independent.

#### Roar News (2017-2020)
Editor & Proofreader
- This role trained me in forensic editing and proof-reading.
- It was important for me to rigorously fact check all submissions whilst actively communicating with both the writer and the chief editor, respectively.


#### Action Tutoring (2021-present)
Volunteer English Tutor
- Helping teach disadvantaged children, aged 9-15, struggling with English.
- Either in groups or 1 on 1, I found the process of supporting these children through their school terms and watching their confidence grow extremely rewarding.

## Skills


#### Fast Learner
- At the end of the Makers course, I was placed in a team and tasked with creating a web app entirely of our own design. Guidance was minimal and the coaches encouraged us to learn a new technology in the two weeks assigned.
- My team decided we would create a MERN stack application from scratch. We chose something that neither of us had any experience with, as eachother's learning was our sole objective.With 5 hours of a React tutorial under my belt I fell into the position of leading the frontend of the application.
- There wasn‚Äôt time to continue the 16 hour tutorial, we had to deliver our MVP (Minimum Viable Product) quick. Over the course of the next couple days I put great emphasis on individual study, going through React documentation, drawing up diagrams, and utilizing smart Google searches to get the exact information and understanding I needed. I then coupled this with extensive pair-programming with my teammates to ensure everyone felt comfortable with the framework.
- In just three days we delivered our MVP. At the end of the project we had a fully featured, responsive, MERN stack application. I am proud to say I spearheaded the application's frontend and having utilised pair-programming I‚Äôd been able to support my teammates' own learning, so that all of us could understood the code we‚Äôd written together.


#### Team Player // Pair Programming
- As part of my training at Makers Academy, great emphasis was put on pair-programming to help bolster our learning with as they introduced new concepts on a weekly basis. It was easy to fall behind and on one occasion my colleague with whom I was paired was struggling with the design pattern,  Dependency Injection.
- Although my partner insisted that we should part ways and work individually, I assured them I had no interest in furthering my own progress with the course materials.
- I recalled my time as an English Tutor, and took time and care to help my colleague build their confidence in this vital aspect of Object Oriented Engineering with which I‚Äôd struggled with myself. Using diagrams, mapping out the logic on Miro boards, and going back through previous exercises, I instructed my partner in the complexities of this design pattern.
- I was reminded of the jiu jitsu classes I attend, and the progress I‚Äôd made from the help of others more experienced. In martial arts the community is vital to the process of learning. Therein is a culture of those who are more experienced helping those who are less experienced. A virtue I believe should be encouraged and shared in any workplace.
- When you help someone less experienced you empower them and in turn empower yourself and your community. My colleague went on to gain solid understanding of this difficult concept. Whereas I was both glad I consolidated my own learning by helping another and pleased that I contributed to our own Makers cohort community.




#### Meeting Deadlines

- In my role as a Editorial Assistant at a fast-paced startup, The Cultural Me, the director gave us, a team of four, two months to produce fourteen high-quality educational presentations on various topics
- The production of just one of these presentations required intense study of a single subject, in order to educate others about it authorititavely and comprehensively.
- Leading the team I utilised trello boards to work in several day Agile sprints, where I would host morning stand-ups where the team could pitch ideas, draft presentations, and even arrane to meet up and record video content for our final pieces. 
- We met our deadline and delivered a pitch that received commendations from such organisations as SOAS university and Tower Hamlets council. With the work we did our director went on to secure government funding for the company
